# Instahooks
A webhook that listens for Instagram mentions on a particular account. On mention, after verification that this is a valid request, the webhook writes the user data for the mentioner to Realtime Database. This data is displayed in JSON form on a locally hosted webpage that is easily tunneled via ngrok.
